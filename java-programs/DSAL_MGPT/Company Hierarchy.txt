Company Hierarchy
Consider a company having a CEO, the head of the company. The CEO can have many
employees directly reporting to him and each of these employees can have other employees
reporting to them and so on. This organization of employees in the company gives rise to a
hierarchical structure of employees representing boss-subordinate relationship between
employees. Each employee in the Company has unique id(maximum 25 characters). The
company will always have one CEO identified by an id, "CEO".
Hierarchy of the organization will be the input to your program, you will have to find immediate
common boss of any two different employees of the company. Immediate common boss of
the two employees is an employee deepest in the hierarchy, to whom these two employees
report either directly or indirectly (a common ancestor of both the employees).
Input Specification
Input will consist of several lines specifying the boss subordinate relationships between the
employees terminating with string “END”. Each of the lines will be of the following format.
Each field is separated by a blank space.
<emp-id> <N> <emp-id1> <emp-id2> .. <emp-idN>
where,
<emp-id> : employee id of boss
<N> : number of subordinates directly reporting to emp-id
<emp-id1> ... <emp-idN> : employee ids of N subordinates
The last line will consist of two employee ids, E1 and E2, separated by a blank space.
Assume that an employee id will appear as a subordinate before it appears as a boss in the
input. Also assume that E1 will not be an ancestor of E2 and vice verse.
Output Specification
The output should consist of employee id of the immediate common boss of both E1 and E2.
Terminate the output with a new line character.
