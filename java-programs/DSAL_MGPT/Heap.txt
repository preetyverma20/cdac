Heap
You have to write a program to compare POST ORDER traversal of a MAX HEAP with PRE
ORDER traversal of a MIN HEAP. Given two sequences of integers, construct MAX HEAP
from the first sequence and MIN HEAP from the second sequence. After performing the
specified number of deletions on the heaps, compare the POST ORDER traversal of MAX
HEAP and PRE ORDER traversal of the MIN HEAP. If these traversals produce same
sequence of integers, print YES. Print NO otherwise.
Input Specification
Input will contain two lines, first for MAX HEAP and second for MIN HEAP. Each line will start
with a positive integer N followed by N+1 integers. The first integer, N, is the number of
integers to be inserted in to the heap. The following N integers (all unique) are to be inserted
into the corresponding heap. The last integer, D (0 <= D <N), specifies the number of
deletions to be performed on the corresponding heap.
You can assume that the maximum number of elements in each heap is 50.
Output Specification
The output will be in three lines. The first two lines of output should print the POST ORDER
and PRE ORDER traversals, obtained after all deletion operations are performed on MAX
HEAP and MIN HEAP, respectively. Integers in each traversal should be separated by a
blank space. The last line should print YES if both the above traversals produce same
sequence of integers. Print NO otherwise. Terminate each output line with a new line
character.
Sample Input
5 5 3 7 6 4 1
4 3 4 6 5 0
Sample output
3 4 5 6
3 4 5 6
YES
