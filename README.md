## CDAC Projects

All the projects done during CDAC (formerly National Center for Software Technology) course 
i.e. Post Graduate Diploma in Software technology

### CPU Scheduling Algorithms Simulation
This project contains a .C program file that can be used to simulate four CPU Scheduling algorithms namely: 
* First Come First Serve (Non-Preemptive)
* Shortest Process Next (Non-Preemptive)
* Shortest Remaining Time (Preemptive)
* Round Robin (Preemptive)

### HTTP proxy server with Caching

### Programming-Paradigm
