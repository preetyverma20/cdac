## CDAC Projects

All the projects done during CDAC (formerly National Center for Software Technology) courses namely:
* Post Graduate Diploma in Software technology
* Advanced Post Graduate Diploma in Software technology

### CPU Scheduling Algorithms Simulation
This project contains a .C program file that can be used to simulate four CPU Scheduling algorithms namely: 
* First Come First Serve (Non-Preemptive)
* Shortest Process Next (Non-Preemptive)
* Shortest Remaining Time (Preemptive)
* Round Robin (Preemptive)

### HTTP proxy server with Caching
This is a HTTP Proxy Server developed in Java. This proxy server has following features built into it.
* Authentication for users - This service is provided to restrict access to the proxy server. Only users with valid username and password can access the proxy.
* Bandwidth Management - This service is used to restrict the bandwidth for different users.
* User Time out - This service is provided to log out the user from the proxy if he is in-active from 30 minutes.
* Block Sites - Restrict access to specified sites.

For more information, please check the document inside the folder: "HTTP proxy server with Caching"

### OOAD - Game Of Bricks
This contains Game of Bricks developed in Java. This project was done as part of Object Oriented Analysis and Design module of CDAC's course.

### PCCP - Game Of Bricks
This contains Game of Bricks developed in C++ and curses library. This project was done as part of Programming in C and C++ module of CDAC's course.

### Programming-Paradigm
The document "Programming-Paradigm-Project.doc" in this folder explains five different programming paradigms.
* Object-oriented programming
* Imperative / Procedural Programming
* Functional programming
* Logical programming 
* Constraint Programming

The "Problem Solutions" folder contains solution to a problem in four different programming languages representing one of the programming paradigms.

### Simulation of Network Routing Protocols
This project contains two Java files one for each of the following Network Routing protocol simulation.
* Distance Vector Routing
* Link State Routing
