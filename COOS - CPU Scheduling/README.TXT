CPU Scheduling Algorithms Simulation
(Group No. : PG02CS03)

Platform : Windows

Language used : C

Compiler used : Turbo C

The source code is in the files:
1) header.h
	It contains the declrations of structures, functions and global variable used in the program.

2) CPU-CS03.c
	It contains the definitions of all the functions used in the program.

The Other files present in the submit directory are
1) Mainq.dat
	It is generated when the program is executed. It contains the information of all processes generated during execution of the program.

2) Design Document.doc
	It contains the design document that was submitted in the mid-module.

3) Details of Implementation.doc
	It contains the detailed description of all the global variables, structure declarations and functions used in the program.

4) CPU-CS03.exe
	An executable file of the program.

5) Four txt file namely fcfs.txt, spn.txt, srn.txt and rr.txt
	These files are generated during execution of the program and contain the final results of each algorithm.
fcfs.txt - First Come First Serve
spn.txt - Shortest Process Next
srt.txt -   Shortest Remaining Time
rr.txt   -   Round Robin
